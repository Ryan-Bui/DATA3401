So is it not with me as with that Muse Stirr'd by a painted beauty to his verse, Who heaven itself for ornament doth use  every fair with his fair doth rehearse Making a couplement of proud compare, With sun  moon, with earth  sea's rich gems, With April's first-born flowers,  all things rare That heaven's air this huge rondure hems. O' let me, true love, but truly write,  then believe me, my love is as fair As any mother's child, though not so bright As those gold cles fix'd heaven's air: Let them say more than like of hearsay well; I will not praise that purpose not to sell.
